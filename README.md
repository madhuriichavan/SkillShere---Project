 <h2>Platform	:	 MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS</h2>			 
 	Description	:	SkillSphere is a full-stack MERN Learning Management System I developed, delivering a secure,
  role-based e-learning platform for Admins, Instructors, and Learners. 
  I built a responsive React.js frontend with React Router, Bootstrap and React Toastify notifications, 
  paired with a Node.js-Express backend featuring RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, bcrypt hashing, and custom middleware for role-based access control. 
  Using MongoDB with Mongoose, I designed normalized schemas, optimized indexes, while implementing atomic enrollment logic to ensure data integrity. 
  This project strengthened my expertise in scalable architecture, secure authentication, system design, and end-to-end developmentresulting in a 
  production-ready application extensible to microservices and cloud deployment.
